# GoLang Programming Projects

## What is this?

This is going to be my remote repository host for all Go projects, while I learn go. Projects will be organized in directories, with sub directories if I am organizing in a specific way.

## Code Standards

Every project gets a `README.md`

- Getting Started
- Running Tests 

**Branching Structure**
- Branching structure project: `project/project_name`
- Branching structure feature: `project/project_name/feature/feature_name`



**Commit message format** 
- `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
