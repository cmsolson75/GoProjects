# GoLang Programming Projects

## What is this?

This is going to be my remote repository host for all Go projects, while I learn go. Projects will be organized in directories, with sub directories if I am organizing in a specific way.

## Code Standards

Every project gets a `README.md`
- Title
- Description
- Features
- Getting Started
- Running Tests 

**Branching Structure**
- Branching structure project: `project/project_name`
- Branching structure feature: `project/project_name/feature/feature_name`



**Commit message format** 
- `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
**type guide**
- feat: A new feature.
- fix: A bug fix.
- chore: Maintenance or refactoring that doesnâ€™t affect the functionality (e.g., updating dependencies).
- docs: Documentation changes.
- style: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, missing semicolons).
- refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature (e.g., code improvements).
- test: Adding or modifying tests.
- perf: A code change that improves performance.
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (e.g., Maven, Gradle).
- ci: Changes to the CI/CD configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis).
