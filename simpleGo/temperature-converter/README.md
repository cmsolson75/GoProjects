# Temperature Conversion Program

## Project Goals
Learn a bit of the Cobra library in Go. Choosing a simple project. This will be a poor use of Cobra, I just want to use the `cobra-cli` to make the command structure, and with that add in my logic. The user experience doesnt matter, this is a throwaway project I am going to keep for a reference to how to use Cobra.

Add in sub commands using flags

Have basic tests

Use Structs & Methods
